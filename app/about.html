    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Blast From the Past began in 1980, with Jim Stark conducting. Stark formerly directed the Midland High School band. Originally, retired musicians were recruited to join. For the past 35 years, the group has rehearsed every Monday night, except the first one, for the entire season, to play for a dedicated following.</p>
